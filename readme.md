# MICO Custom Taxonomy: Seasons
This is a very simple plugin, with the only purpose of adding a 
translation ready taxonomy named "seasons" to wordpress. 

Out of the box you wont be able to see this in the admin. 
You need to add it to an existing post type like so:

```PHP
 
	/**
	 * Add taxonomies to objects
	 */
	add_action( 'wp_loaded', 'add_tax_to_post_type', 0);
	function add_tax_to_post_type() {
		register_taxonomy_for_object_type('season', 'performance');
	}

```

Best to add this to a client-function plugin
